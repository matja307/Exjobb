\chapter{An introduction to silicon carbide}
\label{sec:sic}
This chapter describes the relevant properties of SiC. Section \ref{sec:crystal_structure} describes the atomic arrangement in the material, and some different arrangements are discussed. Section \ref{sec:band_structure} discusses the energy band structure of 3C-SiC. Finally section \ref{sec:doping_in_3C} describes the mechanism and some effects of doping in 3C-SiC. 

\section{Crystal structure}
\label{sec:crystal_structure}
Silicon carbide is a crystalline material consisting of silicon and carbon atoms. The crystalline nature of the material means that the atoms are arranged in a periodically repeating structure called a \emph{lattice}. For given chemical elements there may be several different ways to arrange the atoms in a lattice, i.e. different chemical compounds of the same types of atoms. This is called \emph{polytypism}, where the different lattice structures are called \emph{polytypes} of the material. SiC has a large number of different polytypes. There are more than 250 known polytypes of SiC \cite{Cheung2006}. The different polytypes can be described as different stacking orders of hexagonal layers of atoms \cite{Mirgorodsky1995}.
