  I wish to thank my supervisor, Jianwu Sun, for teaching me the experimental methods and for invaluable guidance in interpreting the results. I also wish to direct my thanks to Mikael Syväjärvi - thank you for taking me in as a master's student in your lab, and for the help and input in planning my work and writing this thesis. I really appreciate having had the opportunity to be a member of your group during this time. Finally thank you also to Valdas Jokubavicius and Xinyu Liu for your support and guidance in the lab.
