\chapter{Characterization techniques}
\label{sec:characterization}
To investigate the material properties after growth, the samples must be characterized. There are many established techniques to do this. This chapter gives a description of the characterization techniques used to obtain the results in this thesis. This thesis focuses mainly on the optical properties of the grown samples, but the work also includes some morphology studies. The specifics of the experiments performed are given in chapter \ref{sec:experimental_details}.
