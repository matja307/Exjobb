This thesis describes the growth and optical characterization of cubic silicon carbide (\emph{SiC}). SiC is a semiconductor which has attracted academic interest since the 19:th century, when it was first fabricated and used as an abrasive \cite{Acheson1893}. SiC has been found to be a very stable material. It exhibits a high chemical inertness \cite{Hume1941}, and is currently commonly used in high power and high temperature applications due to its ability to survive in such environments [Citation?]. 

SiC is a material which exists in a large number of different polytypes, the most common of which are hexagonal, cubic and rhombohedral. The work described in this thesis deals with the only cubic polytype, denoted \emph{3C}. This is one of the structurally most simple polytypes. Compared to the hexagonal counterparts 4H and 6H, the 3C polytype has for a long time been difficult to fabricate in good quality single crystal form, and is therefore less studied than the hexagonal types [Citation needed]. Recently a method of fabricating good quality material has been reported, using sublimation epitaxy \cite{Jokubavicius2014}. The method, called fast sublimation growth process (\emph{FSGP}), has been used to grow the samples used in the work described in this thesis. %Should decide how I should call 3C (3C-SiC, cubic SiC...?)

Cubic SiC has many interesting material properties, which have given rise to several proposals of applications for 3C. Some of these proposed applications are not possible to create with the hexagonal polytypes, but are unique for the cubic polytype. One such application is the use of boron doped 3C in an impurity photovoltaic solar cell (\emph{IPV}). This is suitable for 3C due to its band gap size together with the binding energy of boron as an acceptor in the material, which is almost ideal for photovoltaic cell material. This would give a significant increase in photovoltaic cell efficiency compared to the currently commercially available alternatives \cite{Richards2003}[Current efficiencies citation needed]. Another proposed application of 3C is as a photo-electrode in a photoelectrochemical cell used for water splitting \cite{Kato2014,Yasuda2012}, where solar energy is used in the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. 

This thesis deals with characterization of the optical properties of boron doped 3C-SiC. This is done using absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, \dots. Chapter \ref{sec:sic} gives an introduction to silicon carbide, its structure and properties. Chapter \ref{sec:growth} describes the process of growing the material. Both growth of undoped and boron doped material is described here. In chapter \ref{sec:characterization} a description of the different characterization methods is given, together with a theoretical description of what the measurements can tell about material properties. Chapter \ref{sec:experimental} describes how the experiments were done and chapter \ref{sec:results} describes the results obtained from the experiments. The results are discussed in chapter \ref{sec:discussion}. Chapters \ref{sec:conclusion} and \ref{sec:future} discuss what has been learned about the material and how the work should be continued in the future.
