\chapter{Results}
In this chapter, the results of the experiments are shown. The results are further discussed in chapter \ref{sec:discussion}.

To investigate growth of seeds to be used for B-doping, seeds were grown on both carbon and silicon face of the 4H-SiC. Table \ref{tab:seeds} shows the growth conditions and properties of the seeds grown on carbon face. The sample thickness is excluding the substrate thickness. Terrace coverage indicates the percentage of the step flow terrace covered by 3C-SiC rather than any other polytype. The silicon face seeds were all grown at temperature XXX during a time of XXX. Nine out of ten of the silicon face grown seeds had a terrace coverage of 100 \%, whereas none of the carbon face samples had complete terrace coverage. 

Figures \ref{fig:carbon_seed1} and \ref{fig:carbon_seed2} show representative micrographs of the terrace of a carbon face grown seed. Figure \ref{fig:carbon_seed1} shows a reflection mode micrograph. It can clearly be seen that there are a few large areas of different polytypes. The hexagonal polytype regions show spiral growth, which on carbon face 4H-SiC manifests as a star shape. The 3C-SiC regions look much smoother, and show some of the characteristic triangle shapes. Figure \ref{fig:carbon_seed2} shows a Nomarski mode micrograph, showing clear contrast between the different polytype regions. 

\begin{table}[h]

Table \ref{tab:doped_samples} shows the growth conditions and sample thickness of the grown B-doped samples. The thickness is measured for the doped layer, excluding both the substrate and the undoped seed. The growth mode is the stacking order of the doped and undoped source materials in the crucible, as described in section \ref{sec:growth:fsgp:doping}. 

Figure \ref{fig:B_doped_micrographs1} shows the surface morphology of an undoped sample (a), doped sample number XXX (b), doped sample number YYY (c). The depicted area is chosen to be an area with among the fewest defects possible. It is clearly seen that the undoped sample has a better crystal quality compared to the doped ones. This result was a trend with all grown samples. It should be noted that (b) and (c) show a directly and indirectly doped sample respectively.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:B_doped_micrographs2} (a)-(c) shows micrographs of samples XXX, YYY and ZZZ respectively. It should be noted that these samples are grown using a source material doped with dopant concentration of 10$^{18}$, 10$^{19}$ and 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ respectively. \emph{Write about crystal quality here}. 

Fig. 

Figure \ref{fig:BGe20_micrograph} shows a transmission mode micrograph of sample XXX (\emph{BGe20}). It can be seen that there are two different polytypes in the sample. The brighter area in the center is a foreign polytype inclusion.

Absorption measurements were done on directly doped samples with different source doping concentrations (\emph{feb 18 small, may 19 free}). The results of these measurements are shown in figure \ref{fig:abs1}, together with a reference spectrum from an undoped sample (dotted line). In both samples we see the VB to nitrogen transition at around 500 nm. A second feature in the doped sample spectra is the peak at around 700 nm, corresponding to the transition between the boron and nitrogen levels. This cannot be seen in the undoped sample. The doped samples show no evidence for a VB to boron transition, which should be seen at around 1800 nm. The irregular behaviour of the graph around 900 nm is thought to be a combination of noise and background subtraction error, as it is present in all samples.  Absorption was also measured for doped samples XXX and YYY, (\emph{e20 samples}) but neither the band edge nor the boron related peaks was seen in these highly doped samples.
