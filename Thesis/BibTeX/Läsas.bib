abstract = {Low (keV) and high (MeV) energy Al and B implants were performed into n‐type 6H‐ and 3C‐SiC at both room temperature and 850 °C. The material was annealed at 1100, 1200, or 1400 °C for 10 min and characterized by secondary ion mass spectrometry, Rutherford backscattering (RBS), photoluminescence, Hall and capacitance‐voltage measurement techniques. For both Al and B implants, the implant species was gettered at 0.7 Rp (where Rp is the projected range) in samples implanted at 850 °C and annealed at 1400 °C. In the samples that were amorphized by the room temperature implantation, a distinct damage peak remained in the RBS spectrum even after 1400 °C annealing. For the samples implanted at 850 °C, which were not amorphized, the damage peak disappeared after 1400 °C annealing. P‐type conduction is observed only in samples implanted by Al at 850 °C and annealed at 1400 °C in Ar, with 1\% dopant electrical activation.},

abstract = {Low-temperature photoluminescence studies of 26 cubic SiC films, ranging in thickness from 600 A to 25 microns, grown by CVD on (100)Si are presented. It is suggested that the G band near 1.90-1.92 eV and its phonon side bands G1 and G2 are related to dislocations and extended defects. Formulas for the band-gap shift due to an axial stress have been obtained and applied to the CVD 3C-SiC/Si system. The results indicate that a 1-3-micron transition layer greatly reduces the interface misfit strain, and that biaxial stress in the SiC/Si system depresses the intensity of the no-phonon line.},

abstract = {As an alternative to the conventional phosphors in white LEDs, a donor and acceptor co-doped fluorescent 6H-SiC can be used as an ultraviolet-to-visible light converter without any need of rare-earth metals. From experimental data we provide an explanation to how light can be obtained at room temperature by a balance of the donors and acceptors. A steady-state recombination rate model is used to demonstrate that the luminescence in fluorescent SiC can be enhanced by controlling the donor and acceptor doping levels. A doping criterion for optimization of this luminescence is thus proposed.},

@article{Sridhara1998,
abstract = {Two distinct boron-related centers are known in silicon carbide polytypes, one shallow (ionization energy  ∼ 300 meV) and the other deep ( ∼ 650 meV). In this work, 4H SiC homoepitaxial films are intentionally doped with the shallow boron center by controlling the silicon to carbon source gas ratio during chemical vapor deposition, based on site competition epitaxy. The dominance of the shallow boron center for samples grown with a low Si/C ratio, favoring the incorporation of boron onto the silicon sublattice, is verified by the temperature dependent Hall effect, admittance spectroscopy and deep level transient spectroscopy. In these samples a peak near 3838 \AA appears in the low temperature photoluminescence spectrum. Further experiments support the identification of this peak with the recombination of a four particle (bound exciton) complex associated with the neutral shallow boron acceptor as follows: (1) The intensity of the 3838 \AA peak grows with added boron. (2) Momentum conserving phonon replicas are observed, with energies consistent with other four particle complexes in SiC. (3) With increasing temperature excited states are observed, as for the neutral aluminum and gallium acceptor four particle complexes. However, the intensity of the shallow boron spectrum is quenched at lower temperatures than the corresponding spectra for Al and Ga, and the lineshapes are strongly sample dependent. These results may be related to the unusual configurational and electronic structure of this center inferred from recent spin resonance experiments by other groups. When the Si/C ratio is high, the optical signatures of the deep boron center, nitrogen-boron donor-acceptor pairs and conduction band to neutral acceptor free-to-bound transitions, are observed in the photoluminescence. At T = 2 K well resolved, detailed nitrogen-boron pair line spectra are observed in addition to the peak due to distant pairs. As the temperature is raised, the donor-acceptor pair spectrum decreases in intensity while the free-to-bound no-phonon peak appears. Extrapolation of the temperature dependence of the free-to-bound peak to T = 0 K, after correction for the temperature dependence of the exciton energy gap, leads to the value EA(B)−EX = 628±1 meV, where EA(B) is the ionization energy of the deep boron center and EX is the binding energy of the free exciton which, for 4H SiC, can only be estimated at this time. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},
