@article{Luque1997,
abstract = {Recent attempts have been made to increase the efficiency of solar cells by introducing an impurity level in the semiconductor band gap. We present an analysis of such a structure under ideal conditions. We prove that its efficiency can exceed not only the Shockley and Queisser efficiency for ideal solar cells but also that for ideal two-terminal tandem cells which use two semiconductors, as well as that predicted for ideal cells with quantum efficiency above one but less than two.},
