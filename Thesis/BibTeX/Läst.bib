@article{Vasiliauskas2012,
abstract = {The nucleation of cubic (3C) SiC on on-axis 6H-SiC was investigated in the temperature range 1500–1775 °C by the technique of sublimation epitaxy. We have studied two different cases: (i) the initial homoepitaxial growth of 6H-SiC followed by nucleation of 3C-SiC and (ii) nucleation of homoepitaxial 6H-SiC islands. The supersaturation in the growth cell was calculated using the modeled source to substrate temperature difference. We show that, at low temperature and supersaturation, growth of 6H-SiC commences in spiral growth mode, which prepares the surface for 3C-SiC nucleation. Provided the supersaturation is high enough, the 3C-SiC nucleates as two-dimensional islands on terraces of the homoepitaxial 6H-SiC. Detailed structural study indicates that the 3C-SiC began to grow on defect free surfaces. From the experimental and modeling results, we show that the growth parameter window for 3C-SiC is rather narrow. Deviation from it can result in 6H-SiC growth in spiral or 2D-nucleation mode, which suggests the importance of knowledge of supersaturation.},

@article{Sun2012b,
abstract = {As a challenge and consequence due to its metastable nature, cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) has only shown inferior material quality compared with the established hexagonal polytypes. We report on growth of 3C-SiC(111) having a state of the art semiconductor quality in the SiC polytype family. The x-ray diffraction and low temperature photoluminescence measurements show that the cubic structure can indeed reach a very high crystal quality. As an ultimate device property, this material demonstrates a measured carrier lifetime of 8.2 mu s which is comparable with the best carrier lifetime in 4 H-SiC layers. In a 760-mu m thick layer, we show that the interface recombination can be neglected since almost all excess carriers recombines before reaching the interface while the surface recombination significantly reduces the carrier lifetime. In fact, a comparison of experimental lifetimes with numerical simulations indicates that the real bulk lifetime in such high quality 3C-SiC is in the range of 10-15 mu s.},
