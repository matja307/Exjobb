abstract = {The analysis of the infrared absorption bands in amorphous Ge which correspond to transitions between the three branches of the valence band has shown that the valence band wave-functions are delocalized over distances of the order 102\AA. This is in sharp contrast with the observed low electrical conductivity. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. A general formula for absorption in amorphous structures is discussed and applied to the analysis of the absorption edges in Ge and Si.},

abstract = {A reproducible process is described for growing a thick single-crystal layer of cubic SiC on a single-crystal Si wafer by chemical vapor deposition. A buffer layer, grown in situ, is used between the cubic SiC and the Si substrate to minimize the effect of lattice mismatch. Layers of up to 34 microns thick and several sq cm in area have been grown. Wafers are obtained by chemically removing the Si substrates from the grown layers. Excellent electron channeling patterns produced by these wafers indicate very good crystal quality. Preliminary electrical measurements have yielded electron mobilities up to 380 sq cm/Vs.},

@article{Ivanov1999,
abstract = {The present paper is an analytical review of the last five or six years of research and development in SiC. It outlines the major achievements in single crystal growth and device technology. Electrical performance of SiC devices designed during these years and some new trends in SiC electronics are also discussed. During the 1980s the studies on sublimation and liquid-phase epitaxial growth of SiC single crystal were continued successfully. At that time, such methods as chemical vapour deposition, thermal oxidation, `dry' plasma etching and ion implantation which yielded good results with silicon, came into use. As a result of the technological progress, discrete devices appeared, which incorporated the potential advantages of SiC as a wide bandgap material. Among these were high temperature (500-600C) rectifier diodes and field-effect transistors, high efficiency light-emitting diodes for the short-wave region of the visible spectrum, and detectors of ultraviolet radiation. It should be stressed that the devices were of commercial quality and could be applied in various fields (control systems of automobile engines, aerospace apparatus, geophysical equipment, colour displays in information systems, etc.). The developments in technology and the promising results of research on electrical performance of the devices already available give hope that in the near future SiC may become the basic material for power microwave devices, and for thermo- and radiation-resistant integrated circuits. This process can be stimulated by further perfection of single-crystal substrates of large area, by development of stable high temperature ohmic contacts, micro- and heterostructures},

This includes (i) a simple valence force field, whose parameters were in part derived from the quantum-mechanical calculations of the appropriate molecule, in part from a fitting procedure, and (ii) a charge distribution model regarding the electron transfer between bonded atoms as a response to the change of interatomic separation. A conflict exists in the literature about the elastic properties of 3C-SiC, and our opinion on the most reliable data is given. Complete sets of elastic and piezoelectric tensor elements derived from the model calculations are presented for all materials under consideration.
