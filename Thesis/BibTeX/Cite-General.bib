@article{Ivanov2010,
abstract = {Donor-acceptor pair luminescence of P–Al and N–Al pairs in 3C–SiC is analyzed. The structures in the spectra corresponding to recombination of pairs at intermediate distances are fitted with theoretical spectra of type I (P–Al pairs) and type II (N–Al pairs). It is shown that in the regions chosen for fitting the line positions obey the equation ℏ$\omega$(R) = EG−ED−EA+e2/$\epsilon$R, where ℏ$\omega$(R) is the energy of the photon emitted by recombination of a pair at a distance R, e is the electron charge, $\epsilon$ is the static dielectric constant, and EG, ED, and EA are the electronic band gap and the donor and acceptor ionization energies, respectively. The fits yield the values EG−ED−EA for the N–Al (2094 meV) and P–Al (2100.1 meV) cases. Using the known value of the nitrogen ionization energy, 54.2 meV, phosphorus ionization energy of 48.1 meV is obtained. Identification of the sharp lines corresponding to recombination of close pairs in the P–Al spectrum is suggested.},

abstract = {We present the results of a lattice-dynamical treatment of the 3C, 2H, 4H, and 6H structures of SiC, performed within the framework of an unified approach. This includes (i) a simple valence force field, whose parameters were in part derived from the quantum-mechanical calculations of the appropriate molecule, in part from a fitting procedure, and (ii) a charge distribution model regarding the electron transfer between bonded atoms as a response to the change of interatomic separation. A conflict exists in the literature about the elastic properties of 3C-SiC, and our opinion on the most reliable data is given. Complete sets of elastic and piezoelectric tensor elements derived from the model calculations are presented for all materials under consideration. The chemical regularity in the variation of sign of the e14<math><mrow><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">e<mrow><mn>14 piezoelectric constants from the I-VII to IV-IV members of the sphalerite family is discussed in light of the present model.},
