abstract = {We present the results of a lattice-dynamical treatment of the 3C, 2H, 4H, and 6H structures of SiC, performed within the framework of an unified approach. This includes (i) a simple valence force field, whose parameters were in part derived from the quantum-mechanical calculations of the appropriate molecule, in part from a fitting procedure, and (ii) a charge distribution model regarding the electron transfer between bonded atoms as a response to the change of interatomic separation. A conflict exists in the literature about the elastic properties of 3C-SiC, and our opinion on the most reliable data is given. Complete sets of elastic and piezoelectric tensor elements derived from the model calculations are presented for all materials under consideration. The chemical regularity in the variation of sign of the e14<math><mrow><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">e<mrow><mn>14 piezoelectric constants from the I-VII to IV-IV members of the sphalerite family is discussed in light of the present model.},

@article{Sun2012b,
abstract = {As a challenge and consequence due to its metastable nature, cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) has only shown inferior material quality compared with the established hexagonal polytypes. We report on growth of 3C-SiC(111) having a state of the art semiconductor quality in the SiC polytype family. The x-ray diffraction and low temperature photoluminescence measurements show that the cubic structure can indeed reach a very high crystal quality. As an ultimate device property, this material demonstrates a measured carrier lifetime of 8.2 mu s which is comparable with the best carrier lifetime in 4 H-SiC layers. In a 760-mu m thick layer, we show that the interface recombination can be neglected since almost all excess carriers recombines before reaching the interface while the surface recombination significantly reduces the carrier lifetime. In fact, a comparison of experimental lifetimes with numerical simulations indicates that the real bulk lifetime in such high quality 3C-SiC is in the range of 10-15 mu s.},
