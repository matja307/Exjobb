@article{Nishino1983,
abstract = {A reproducible process is described for growing a thick single-crystal layer of cubic SiC on a single-crystal Si wafer by chemical vapor deposition. A buffer layer, grown in situ, is used between the cubic SiC and the Si substrate to minimize the effect of lattice mismatch. Layers of up to 34 microns thick and several sq cm in area have been grown. Wafers are obtained by chemically removing the Si substrates from the grown layers. Excellent electron channeling patterns produced by these wafers indicate very good crystal quality. Preliminary electrical measurements have yielded electron mobilities up to 380 sq cm/Vs.},

@article{Vasiliauskas2012,
abstract = {The nucleation of cubic (3C) SiC on on-axis 6H-SiC was investigated in the temperature range 1500–1775 °C by the technique of sublimation epitaxy. We have studied two different cases: (i) the initial homoepitaxial growth of 6H-SiC followed by nucleation of 3C-SiC and (ii) nucleation of homoepitaxial 6H-SiC islands. The supersaturation in the growth cell was calculated using the modeled source to substrate temperature difference. We show that, at low temperature and supersaturation, growth of 6H-SiC commences in spiral growth mode, which prepares the surface for 3C-SiC nucleation. Provided the supersaturation is high enough, the 3C-SiC nucleates as two-dimensional islands on terraces of the homoepitaxial 6H-SiC. Detailed structural study indicates that the 3C-SiC began to grow on defect free surfaces. From the experimental and modeling results, we show that the growth parameter window for 3C-SiC is rather narrow. Deviation from it can result in 6H-SiC growth in spiral or 2D-nucleation mode, which suggests the importance of knowledge of supersaturation.},

@article{Ivanov1999,
abstract = {The present paper is an analytical review of the last five or six years of research and development in SiC. It outlines the major achievements in single crystal growth and device technology. Electrical performance of SiC devices designed during these years and some new trends in SiC electronics are also discussed. During the 1980s the studies on sublimation and liquid-phase epitaxial growth of SiC single crystal were continued successfully. At that time, such methods as chemical vapour deposition, thermal oxidation, `dry' plasma etching and ion implantation which yielded good results with silicon, came into use. As a result of the technological progress, discrete devices appeared, which incorporated the potential advantages of SiC as a wide bandgap material. Among these were high temperature (500-600C) rectifier diodes and field-effect transistors, high efficiency light-emitting diodes for the short-wave region of the visible spectrum, and detectors of ultraviolet radiation. It should be stressed that the devices were of commercial quality and could be applied in various fields (control systems of automobile engines, aerospace apparatus, geophysical equipment, colour displays in information systems, etc.). The developments in technology and the promising results of research on electrical performance of the devices already available give hope that in the near future SiC may become the basic material for power microwave devices, and for thermo- and radiation-resistant integrated circuits. This process can be stimulated by further perfection of single-crystal substrates of large area, by development of stable high temperature ohmic contacts, micro- and heterostructures},
